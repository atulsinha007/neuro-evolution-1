## Abstract

Neural network as a technology has grown immensely and its multi-layered feed-forward properties make networks particularly suited to complex pattern classification problems. However, their application to real world problems show lack of a training algorithm to find optimal weights.

Genetic algorithms are a class of optimization procedures that are good at finding global optimum for a given problem. Hence genetic algorithm can be used to train neural networks and find optimal values.

In this project we find better ways of training neural networks using evolutionary algorithms and back-propagation on clusters as local search.
